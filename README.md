## Planning Stage
###  Target Audience
- Users who want to test their knowledge on the London Underground.

- Users who want to kill a little time by completing a small quiz instead of being on social media.

### User Stories
- As a user, I want know know facts about the London Underground.

- I want to know if I got a answer right or wrong after I answered the question.
- I want to know my score as I go along the quiz.

### Site Aims
- For users to leave the site learning something new.
- To encourage them to play more quizes.
- To educate the user in their free time instead of going on social media.
- To encourage them to carry on researching about the history and present day trivia about the Underground.

### Colour Schemes
- I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/de2110-ffffff-000000-0009ab) to help me compare the colours I had in mind for this project.
- I used the corperate colours of the London Underground Vermillion red #de2110 and Zaffre blue #0009ab to match the logo. I also used black #000000 and white #FFFFFF to used as main text colours so the quiz can be readable.

### Typeography
- I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to pick the font I was after.
- The main font used for the London Underground (Johnston Typeface) is not avaliable on Google Fonts, so I used one that I thought was simular.
- I used "Open Sans" as the only font in this project as I wanted the font as close to the Johnston Typeface as possible.
- I used it for the titles, in the roundals and the body of the quiz.
- It is easy to read, simple and does not take any attention away from the quiz.
- The back up font I used just in case the users browers cannot use "Open Sans" is Sans Serif.

## Page Content
### General Layout
- The h1 is in the chosen font of "Open Sans" in white, with a vermillion red shadow. This makes it stand out from the rest of the text. The letter spacing as been set to -3, to push the letters together. The background the blue that is slightly transparent so the background can be seen behind it.
- The reset button is located in the bottom left corner of the page. It has the exact same colour scheme as the h1. When the game is in process or finished, the player can choose to press the reset to start again if they want to improve their score. When the button is hovered over, the background and shadow colors swap around.
- In the bottom left of the screen is a logo link to my GitHub page in another tab. It is white, so it stands out aganist the background.
### Start Page
- The start page is the first page the user will see when visiting the site.
- In the centre, there is a transparent white background. It is transparent so the background can still be seen behind it. Inside it is text that welcomes the user. Underneath is an image of a TFL roundal that says START. Clicking on this starts the game, by sending the user to the first question.
