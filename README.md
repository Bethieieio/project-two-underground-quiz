### Colour Schemes
- I used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/de2110-ffffff-000000-0009ab) to help me compare the colours I had in mind for this project.
- I used the corperate colours of the London Underground Vermillion red #de2110 and Zaffre blue #0009ab to match the logo. I also used black #000000 and white #FFFFFF to used as main text colours so the quiz can be readable.

### Typeography
- I used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) to pick the font I was after.
- The main font used for the London Underground (Johnston Typeface) is not avaliable on Google Fonts, so I used one that I thought was simular.
- I used "Open Sans" as the only font in this project as I wanted the font as close to the Johnston Typeface as possible.
- I used it for the titles, in the roundals and the body of the quiz.
- It is easy to read, simple and does not take any attention away from the quiz.
- The back up font I used just in case the users browers cannot use "Open Sans" is Sans Serif.
